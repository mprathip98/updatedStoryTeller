# Interactive Story Teller

----------
About
----------
 - It has a total of three pages:
      - Home - All of the main content lies here
      - About - Quick facts about the project
      - Instructions - Simple instructions to use the app.
 - It has a responsive design, adapting to any screen size.

How To Use
--------------
- It's pretty simple.
- The user is occasionally presented with two options. Click either one to continue on a personalized storytelling path.
- Click 'continue' when there are no options presented.
- Click the 'stop' button to restart and navigate to the intro slide.
- Finally, click the 'reset' button, when the story is done.
- Navigate seamlessly through the app using the navigation menu located at the top left.
